An artist has created an "anti-selfie" Instagram photo series which sees her "play dead" in front of some of the world's most famous tourist attractions. 
Known simply as "STEFDIES" to her followers, the images show Stephanie Leigh lying flat on her face in front of the likes of the Eiffel Tower, Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, and the Golden Gate Bridge in an effort to send a message about "the fleeting sense of life." 
She refuses to provide her age — and even adds that while her "long hair (and swimsuit in selected photos) would allude to the fact that I am a female," she prefers to keep her account "neutral and free of age/ nationality/ politic/ socioeconomic status." 
However, the Mail Online reported that Leigh is based in London but originally from the US. 
She told INSIDER that none of the photos on her Instagram account, which has garnered 40,000 followers, are predetermined or use props. 
Here's how she does it.
