At 88, Warren Buffett, the third richest man in the world, still drinks five cans of Coca-Cola a day, according to his recent interview with British newspaper Financial Times. 
The billionaire admitted during the interview that he lunches on McDonald's chicken nuggets at least three times a week and has, since childhood, taken a quarter of his caloric intake in the form of Coca-Cola. 
Buffett told Fortune in 2015 that if he ate 2700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola. "I drink at least five 12-ounce (340 grams) servings. I do it everyday," he said. 
"I'm not bothered by the thought of my death...I'm not big on superstition -- that can be expensive," he told the FT. 
Speaking in his office in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said he was in no mood to quit: "I'm having a vacation every day. If there was someplace else I wanted to go, I'd go there. This is the pleasure palace here — you're sitting in it now. I have more fun here than I think any 88-year-old is having, virtually, in the world." 
As of April 29, 2019, the net worth of Warren Buffett is US$89.1 billion, making him the third-richest man in the world, according to Forbes.
